     The PDBs listed in the project file will be searched to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB only for parts not already found in the
      Target PDB.

     The schematic source is a Common Data Base.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     Checking for value differences between symbol properties and PartsDB properties

     Checking the validity of the packaging of prepackaged schematic
      symbols.  Only the first error in symbols having the same
      Reference Designator will be reported.

     The packaging of all prepackaged schematic symbols is consistent
      with the Parts DataBase data for the cross mapping of
      symbol pin names to Part Number pin numbers.
      Symbols that were not prepackaged will now be packaged correctly.
      
     No errors in Existing Schematic Packaging.

     The Common DataBase has been read and will be packaged.

Version:  02.11.12

     Netloading the Layout.  Unused components will be changed to spares.

     Unconnected pins will be set to net "(Net0)".

     Schematic reference designator changes will be forward annotated.

     WARNING:  Net "$1N16" is being renamed to "Q3" to match the change
      in the schematic.

     WARNING:  Net "$1N17" is being renamed to "Q2" to match the change
      in the schematic.

     WARNING:  Net "$1N18" is being renamed to "Q0" to match the change
      in the schematic.

     WARNING:  Net "$1N20_14" is being renamed to "$1N20" to match the change
      in the schematic.
